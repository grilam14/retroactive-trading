Retroactive Trading Algorithm

This project is close to allowing one to download a txt file of 1 year of yahoo finance stock data and apply a retroactive trading algorithm to it. The current functionality is primarily to determine the what would have been the optimal retroactive trading strategy over the course of a year. There is also a worst case scenario retroactive analyzer, as well as 3, 6, 9 month breaks etc. 

It is limited now because it is not dynamic. I only have 4 stocks, Apple, Amazon, Chipotle, and Netflix which have hard-coded features (like a description of the company) built into the stock. I created this project for an intro class fall semester 2016, so the implementation of many features are forced due to project requirements.
